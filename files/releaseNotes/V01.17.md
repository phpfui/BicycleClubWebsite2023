 ### New Features

 - Removed non-functional Redirect URL from [Public Pages](/Admin/publicPage), use [Redirects](/System/redirects) instead
 - [SMTP](/System/Settings/smtp) and [IMAP](/System/Settings/email) configation pages no longer have required fields so defaults work better on blank
 - [RWGPS](/RWGPS) membership reenabled when a member renews (was deactivated when they lapsed)
 - [Forum Members](/Forum/manage) no longer throws an error
 - Constant Contact Sync will update user info rather than throw an error
