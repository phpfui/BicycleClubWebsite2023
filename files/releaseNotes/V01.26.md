 ## Version 1.25 (2024-05-13)

 ### New Features
 - You can add multiple RWGPS Routes to a ride. The longest route will be considered the master route for Directions to Start and Statistics
 - [General Admission](/GA/manage) Options and Selections can now be disabled and not visible so you can change things while the event is live
 - [General Admission](/GA/manage) events now have an incomplete registration email ability
 - You can now add non-member [Volunteers](/Volunteer/events)

 ### Bug Fixes
 - Emailing members sets the Reply To field correctly so replies go to the email sender rather than the club domain address
 - The never working General Admission Landing Page editor has been removed
