 ## Version 1.25 (2024-05-12)

 ### New Features
 - You can add multiple RWGPS Routes to a ride. The longest route will be considered the master route for Directions to Start and Statistics
 - General Admission Options and Selections can now be disabled (made not visible) so you can change things while the event is live

 ### Bug Fixes
 - Emailing members sets the Reply To field correctly so replies go to the email sender rather than the club domain address
 - The never working General Admission Landing Page editor has been removed
