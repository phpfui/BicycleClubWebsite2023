Alpine Thermal Long Sleeve Jersey,$121.80 ,"Men's,Women's",2XS-3XL,,,,"AERO FIT: The Alpine Thermal has been designed for cool/cold weather training rides, winter racing and/or commuting in predominantly dry conditions.

Alone it performs well in temperatures ranging betweenÿ40-65øF, with various vestÿand base layer combinations you can easily stay warm down into the low 30's. Reflective placements are subtle, yet extremely bright (350+ Lumens), and have been strategically placed for maximum visibility; on the forearms and down either side of the rear pockets.
