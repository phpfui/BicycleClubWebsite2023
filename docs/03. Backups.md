# Backups

## The following directories contain user content
* **/files**
* **/www/images**
* **/www/pdf**
* **/www/video**
* **/backups**

The above directories should be backed up to a machine other than the web server.

It is the responsibility of the webmaster to ensure these directories are backed up.

The website also makes a nightly local backup of the user files on the webserver.  It is located in the directory above the project directory (or two directories above the www public directory).  It is named "Backup-<your.domain.com>". You can just backup this directory to your local machine for simplicity.

## Database Backups
The database is backed up nightly to the **/backups** directory at 1:30 am. The system does one backup per day.  Backups are archived for the last 7 days, then every week for the last month, then every month, and then every year.

Archived backups are always the last backup taken for a category.  The yearly backup will be from December 31. The monthly backups will be from the last day of the month.  The weekly backups will be from the last day of the week of the month.  The week starts on the first day of the month, so that means the final backups will be 7th, 14th, 21rst, 28th and the last day of the month for week 5.
