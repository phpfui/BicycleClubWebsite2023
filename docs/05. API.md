# API

The website provides a full REST API that can be used to query and update all tables in the database.  You have to add users with specific privledges in order to access the API. Users are authorized via OAuth2 protocol.

## API url

The url to access the API is https://api.yourdommain

## Endpoints

The following end points are defined:

  * POST   /V1/Authorize/password authenticates user and returns a bearer token
  * POST   /V1/Authorize/refreshToken refresh the token with the same credentials as the original token
  * GET    /V1/Schema returns the schema for each table
  * GET    /V1/Schema/table returns the specific table schema
  * GET    /V1/Table/table returns all records in table matching the where clause
  * GET    /V1/Table/table/id returns just info for record with that id
  * POST   /V1/Table/table create a new record
  * PUT    /V1/Table/table update all records matching the where clause
  * PUT    /V1/Table/table/id update a record
  * DELETE /V1/Table/table delete all records matching the where clause
  * DELETE /V1/Table/table/id delete a record

## Where clause parameters for GET, UPDATE or DELETE
  * where = condition to match
  * limit = limit default 100
  * offset = zero based offset of records to return

## Additional parameters for GET
  * fields = select fields, comma delimited, default *
  * sort = asc (default) or desc
  * sortField = field name
  * related = comma separated list of related records to return, or * for all

### Where clause syntax
The where clause is a json encoded array of conditions with the following syntax:
```
condition = [
  logical, // Type: string, must be blank if it is the first condition in a group, or one of the following (AND, OR, AND NOT, OR NOT)
  field, // Type: string, the field name | Type: array, an array of conditions as defined here
  operator, // Type: string, must be one of the following (=, !=, >, >=, <, <=, LIKE, NOT LIKE, IN, NOT IN)
  value, // Type: string | Type: array, for IN and NOT IN operators
  ];
```
operator and value are unused if field is a **condition** array.

### Authentication

API users need to be defined [here](/System/API/users) and assigned access to specific tables. The API uses a bearer token that is valid for 1 hour after issuing.  A refresh token is also provided and valid for 1 month.

To authorize, you POST userName and password to /V1/Authorize/password. A valid response will include bearer_token and refresh_token.

On every request to the API, you must include the header Authorization with the value of "Bearer bearer_token" where bearer_token is what you received from the authorization call.

To refresh a token, you must POST refresh_token to /V1/Authorize/refreshToken.  A valid response will include bearer_token and refresh_token with the same access as the original request.

### Versioning
The API is versioned in terms of routes and parameters.  The data returned is not versioned and may change from release to release. You can use the Schema API to detect changes.

### Sample PHP code:
#### To Authorize
```php
$headers = [
	'Cache-Control' => 'no-cache',
	'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
	'Accept' => 'application/json',
	];

$parameters = ['userName' => 'myUserName', 'password' => 'myPassword'];
$guzzle = new \GuzzleHttp\Client(['headers' => $headers, 'verify' => false, 'http_errors' => false]);
$response = $guzzle->post('http://api.yourdomain/V1/Authorize/password', ['form_params' => $parameters, ]);
$lastError = $response->getReasonPhrase();
$statusCode = $response->getStatusCode();
$data = \json_decode($response->getBody(), true);
print_r($data);
echo "\nLastError: {$lastError}\nStatus: {$statusCode}\n";
````

Save off returned bearer_token and refresh_token

#### To Use
```php
$headers = [
	'Cache-Control' => 'no-cache',
	'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
	'Accept' => 'application/json',
	'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . $data['bearer_token'], // bearer token from above $data
	];

$guzzle = new \GuzzleHttp\Client(['headers' => $headers, 'verify' => false, 'http_errors' => false]);
$response = $guzzle->get('http://api.yourdomain/V1/Table/member?limit=2&sortField=memberId&sort=d&related=membership');
$lastError = $response->getReasonPhrase();
$statusCode = $response->getStatusCode();
$data = \json_decode($response->getBody(), true);
print_r($data);
echo "\nLastError: {$lastError}\nStatus: {$statusCode}\n";
```

#### Refresh Token
```php
$headers = [
	'Cache-Control' => 'no-cache',
	'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
	'Accept' => 'application/json',
	];

$guzzle = new \GuzzleHttp\Client(['headers' => $headers, 'verify' => false, 'http_errors' => false]);
$parameters = ['refresh_token' => $refreshTokenFromAbove];
$response = $guzzle->post('http://api.yourdomain/V1/Authorize/refreshToken', ['form_params' => $parameters, ]);
$lastError = $response->getReasonPhrase();
$statusCode = $response->getStatusCode();
$data = \json_decode($response->getBody(), true);
print_r($data);
echo "\nLastError: {$lastError}\nStatus: {$statusCode}\n";
```
